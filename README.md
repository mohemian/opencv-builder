# OpenCV Builder

This repository contains GitHub Actions workflows for building size-optimized binaries of OpenCV for iOS.

## How to Use

1. Trigger the build pipeline by going to _Actions > Main Workflow > Run workflow_ and specifying a tag from the [opencv/opencv](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/tags) repository to build.
1. Once the pipeline is done, the built binaries will be attached to the workflow run's overview page from where they can be downloaded.
